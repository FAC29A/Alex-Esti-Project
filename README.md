# Crimes Compass

Welcome to the Crimes Compass project! This project is designed to provide a visual representation of crime data using maps and charts. As we embark on this journey, we aim to create an informative and interactive tool for understanding and analyzing crime statistics.

## Project Overview

The objective of Crimes Compass is to utilize the power of police APIs to display crime data on a map. By integrating geographic data with crime statistics, we hope to offer users a comprehensive view of crime patterns in different areas.

### Project Instructions

You can find the detailed project instructions and requirements on our [Project Instructions Page](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/foundation/http/project/). Please review the instructions carefully to ensure that we're on the right track.

## Project Milestones

We will be breaking down the project into several key milestones:

1. **Data Integration**: We will work on fetching and processing data from police APIs, focusing on crime statistics.

2. **Map Integration**: Implementing a map view that displays crime data with a heatmap.

3. **Chart Creation**: Developing charts to visualize the distribution of different types of crimes.

4. **User Interaction**: Enhancing the user experience by allowing users to interact with the map and charts.

5. **Project Deployment**: Preparing the project for deployment.

We look forward to collaborating on this project and turning our vision of Crimes Compass into a reality.
